         I first started development on <strong> GaslightGod.com</strong> while I was violently drunk in 2016, after not renewing the domain for my last shitbox of a website, we ended up here. <br>
         there was probably a point where I should have stopped, but I said 'fuck it' and kept going. To this date I still don't know what the fuck all this is. <br><br>
        <font style="font-size: 16pt">&gt;Updates</font><br>
        - Implemented <strong>+ root</strong> <br>
        - Implemented <strong>+ archive</strong> <br>
        - Implemented <strong>+ main</strong><br>
        - Implemented <strong>+ egirls</strong><br><br>

        <font style="font-size: 16pt">>about:</font><br>
        &nbsp;-&nbsp; <strong>root:</strong> &nbsp; don't ask me why I decided to start with a Unix terminal I was drunk, not much else to say<br>
        &nbsp;-&nbsp; <strong>discordIRC:</strong> &nbsp; I wanted a secure XMPP client that would handle discord messaging. Nothing existed, so I built it myself.  <br>
        &nbsp;-&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>archive: </strong> &nbsp; random things I think are interesting, no rhyme or reason. <br>
        &nbsp;-&nbsp; <strong>egirls:</strong> &nbsp; NSFW collection of egirls, I need to whitelist your inbound for you to access. <br>
        <br><br>Thanks for all the support over the years, make sure to check out external for some websites I think are pretty neat. <br>
