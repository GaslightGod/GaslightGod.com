SOME THINGS I'VE TAKEN NOTE OF ONLINE

U ever notice how CAPTCHA tests got harder?
Used to be “click the fire hydrant” now it’s “identify the metaphysical concept of bus across multiple dimensions.”
Bro, they’re not filtering bots, they’re filtering consciousness. Fail too many and they don’t just think you’re a bot they think you’re something worse.
U ever hear about someone just disappearing from the internet?
They didn’t quit. They got offboarded from the system.

Mandela Effect? Nah. REALITY PATCH NOTES.
Febreze? Berenstain Bears?
“Oh u just remembered wrong” nah bro, ur running an old build of reality. Some ppl never updated from 1.3.6 while we on 2.1.4 beta.
U ever get deja vu but like, sideways? Like you remember something that didn’t happen YET?
That’s because you’re running leaked assets from the next timeline.

Why does Discord eat RAM like it’s rendering the entire universe in 4K?
You think you’re just chatting but every keystroke is harvested.
Messages aren’t text they’re vectorized sentiment maps.
That’s why arguments hit DIFFERENT there.
Try saying the same thing on Instagram DMs it won’t land the same.

Words have different weight classes across platforms because they run on separate linguistic gravity wells.
Ever type out a message stare at it and just not send it?
That’s the algorithm it already saw it.

Change your pfp and suddenly people treat you different.
That’s because Discord recalibrates your entire behavioral model when you swap.
I changed mine once and my whole server started acting weird.
People told me I “felt different.”
BRO WHAT DOES THAT MEAN.

Some people change their pfp too many times and now the algorithm doesn’t know who they are anymore.
They’re statistical ghosts.
Digital skinwalkers.

Spotify shuffle is NEVER actually random.
That’s because your listening habits are being mapped.
You think you’re just vibing but you’re feeding a predictive model of your future mental state.
Ever have a song show up that perfectly matches your mood?
BRO THAT’S NOT THE ALGORITHM GUESSING.
That’s phase 2 of the experiment.
You’re getting mood primed in real time.

Try to rewind a YouTube video and it just jumps back to where you started?
That’s because YouTube doesn’t buffer video it buffers attention.
They don’t care what you’re watching they care about your focus retention vector.
Ever have a video pause and buffer right when you were zoning out?
THAT’S NOT BAD INTERNET.
THAT’S THE SYSTEM TRYING TO RESYNC YOU.

Instagram stories?
Why do they autoplay in the wrong order sometimes?
You think that’s a bug?
Nah. They’re testing alternate engagement patterns.
Some people see a totally different sequence of posts than you do and they don’t even know.

Different internet builds running parallel.
Like how two people can Google the same thing and get totally different results.
The internet isn’t the same for everyone.
There’s no single objective version.

Ever notice how notifications from certain people always pop up at the top?
Like even if someone else messaged first?
That’s because your relationships are being ranked.
Every social media site is mapping out a priority network.
Some people get pushed forward some get phased out.
Ever realize you never see someone’s posts anymore?
They didn’t stop posting.
They got shadow diluted.

And don’t even get me started on AI.
You think it’s just text and images?
Nah, AI is content scaffolding.
Ever see a reply on Twitter that feels a little too generated?
Like it hits all the right beats but something is off?
That’s because AI isn’t just for bots it’s for engagement padding.

Some conversations aren’t even real.
You’re arguing with a reaction simulation.

But nah, go ahead, keep sending “gm” in your Discord server while the system catalogs your wake up time for chronometric analysis.
Keep thinking Twitter posts disappear randomly and that TikTok is just showing you what you “like.”
Keep thinking YouTube buffering is random.

LMAOOOOO.
