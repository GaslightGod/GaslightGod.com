  "version": "1.73",
  "title": "EXP Tracker Update",
  "notes": [
    "Fixed inaccurate EXP/hr caused by long polling intervals. Replaced 8-second polling with a 1-second update listener that reacts instantly to EXP changes.",
    "Improved EXP change detection. The tracker now records the exact moment EXP updates instead of approximating based on poll timing.",
    "Removed the old fallback timing logic that forced server_dt to be at least 5 seconds. EXP/hr now uses the true server update timing.",
    "Cleaned up reset behavior. EXP/hr, AVG, and ETA only reset when EXP decreases or when 90 seconds pass without gain.",
    "Fixed Goal ETA desync. Goal ETA now always uses the latest EXP/hr rate and updates smoothly without freezing.",
    "Overall EXP rate accuracy significantly improved due to real tick-based detection rather than timed sampling."
