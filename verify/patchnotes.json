    "=== v1.7 - Performance Improvements ===",
    "Fixed a mistake in the EXP update loop that caused unnecessary slowdowns.",
    "Cleaned up old leftover code that wasn’t doing anything anymore and was wasting performance.",
    "Optimized how often certain systems update so the overlay feels smoother and responds faster.",
    "Reduced memory usage by removing the graph feature since almost nobody used it and it added a lot of overhead.",
    "Removed the old time-tracking system that wasn’t needed anymore and was slowing down calculations.",
    "Improved the hunger detection loop to make it lighter and more stable.",
    "Overall performance should be noticeably snappier, especially during long sessions."
